.TH HSH 1 "20-November-2017" "Unix" "Simple Shell Man Page"
.SH NAME
.B hsh - holberton shell (command line interpreter)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[command]
[argument]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a command line interpreter that can be used in both an interactive and non-
interative mode. The user should be able to enter a command from the terminal
and have these basic commands executed.
.SH INVOCATION
If the "#cisfun" prompt shows up, this indicates the shell is in interactive
mode and errors may be handled differently here opposed to entering commands in
the standard shell. An example can seen below.
.PP
#cisfun$ /bin/pwd
.SH EXECUTION
Upon execution, the shell will look for builtins first. Then, it will check if
the user is using the relative or absolute path to execute the command if the
the command is not a builtin. Finally, it will execute the command.
.SH ARGUMENTS
For basic shell commands such as ls or cat, the shell can take arguments. These
arguments will be tokenized by the shell and then run. As shown below.
.PP
#cisfun$ ls -la
.SH PATH
There are two ways of entering a command in the shell. Either using the absolute
path or relative path. If the absolute path is not entered, the shell will find
the absolute path itself and execute the command.
